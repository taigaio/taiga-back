## Documentation

Currently, we have authored three main documentation hubs:

- **[API](https://taigaio.github.io/taiga-doc/dist/api.html)**: Our API documentation and reference for developing from Taiga API.
- **[Documentation](https://taigaio.github.io/taiga-doc/dist/)**: If you need to install Taiga on your own server, this is the place to find some guides.
- **[Taiga Resources](https://resources.taiga.io)**: This page is intended to be the support reference page for the users.

## Bug reports

If you **find a bug** in Taiga you can always report it:

- in [Taiga issues](https://tree.taiga.io/project/taiga/issues). **This is the preferred way**
- in [Github issues](https://github.com/taigaio/taiga-back/issues)
- send us a mail to support@taiga.io if is a bug related to [tree.taiga.io](https://tree.taiga.io)
- send us a mail to security@taiga.io if is a **security bug**

One of our fellow Taiga developers will search, find and hunt it as soon as possible.

Please, before reporting a bug, write down how can we reproduce it, your operating system, your browser and version, and if it's possible, a screenshot. Sometimes it takes less time to fix a bug if the developer knows how to find it.
